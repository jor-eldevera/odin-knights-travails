# odin-knights-travails
odin16. This is my solution to the Knights Travails problem. The problem asks, "Build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares a knight will stop on along the way."

The knightMoves function is found in the Board class in Board.js. To print its results, use the printKnightMoves function found in script.js.
